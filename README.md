#Uniformity and ease of setup
This repo is all about creating an easy and productive working environment.
Currently it is highly opinionated and mac specific.**You have been warned.**

The goal is to make it so that as a developer i can use the tools i want quickly and easily. This means as much automation as possible. I know there are good tools for automation out there, but the goal here is also an academic exercise to increase my knowledge of bash and how to make good uniform sand-boxed environments.


**Disclaimer**
Some of the terms and wording may be poor. I don't care. This is meant to help me.
